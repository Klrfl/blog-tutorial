Welcome to my blog! in this post I will tell you how I set up Decap CMS to power my blog.

So first off I watched [this tutorial on setting up Decap CMS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yip2wSRX_4) by Kumail Pirzada.

It all goes well until the blog actually got built and published. The problem is this: I can add new blog posts (like this one), but I can't edit existing ones. It doesn't help that the freaking error message literally looks like this:

![gibberish error message on my blog's admin page.](/assets/screenshot-45-.png)

Oh my god. At the time of this blog's writing, I still haven't figured it out.

Yeah that's it. I just want to vent about this. Idk where or how to fix it :((
