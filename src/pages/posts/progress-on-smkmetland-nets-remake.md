Hello and welcome to my blog! As you have probably known, I am currently attempting to redesign [smkmetland.net](https://smkmetland.net). But of course like all things it doesn't go smoothly at all.

## THE REAL SITE IS DOWN!!!! and more

I don't know why but as of this blog's writing (2023-07-27), smkmetland.net is down, so I cannot fetch any of their articles. When you try to access the site, depending on what device you access it from, you will be greeted with a `404` or a `server not found` error. I asked my friend about this and they said that they probably forgot to pay the hosting fee.

Because of this, I have decided to use another school's articles to fetch from and that is [SMKN 4 Kendal](https://smkn4kendal.sch.id/)'s site. Their website also happens to use WordPress as well and so has a REST API to fetch articles from. Huge thanks to their site administrators!!

Here are some screenshots of the website:

Yeah that's it for all.
