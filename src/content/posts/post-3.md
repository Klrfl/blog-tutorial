So I am still in progress of making a blog site with Astro. I am now in [this section](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/5-astro-api/1/) where you have to use `Astro.glob()` to fetch local files and manipulate them. In this case, we took all the posts in the folder, and displayed each posts' titles in `li`s with JS.

That's it for today's blog posts. Hope I can enjoy being a frontend web dev.
