So because the internal app I'm testing has 300 big pages, I think it's all I am doing for this week. So if I don't post for the whole week, that's because I'm still working on testing these 300 pages. The app is literally just CRUD with really complex joins and business logic, so it's very straightforward to test, it just takes a very long time.

Again wish me luck
