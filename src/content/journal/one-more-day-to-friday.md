To be honest, today I haven't done anything much. I just started on reworking metropolitanland.com, where I used Astro and vanilla CSS for maximum control. I have used CSS Grid for layouts so often that I think I'll make a template of some sorts in the future. Tomorrow we'll turn up the pace.

Also I got home one hour late, so that was the reason I haven't uploaded a post until today. Cheers
