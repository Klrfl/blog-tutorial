Today I decided to put yesterday's UI task on hold and work on a more important one, that is the printout feature. You see all this time i've been working on an internal web app which, among other things, manages some kind of official corporate letter to buy corporate things. It's largely easy because the only thing needed after copying existing pages is to tailor the code to the new feature's needs, so I didn't do much work (if you don't count reading code as work).

So yeah that is the second day of the week. I hope I can find time to work on the UI reactivity stuff tomorrow. Maybe even pitch my idea of using Alpine for embedding light interactive UI stuf, or HTMX for hypermedia, or both even haha. He's not gonna bother is he...
