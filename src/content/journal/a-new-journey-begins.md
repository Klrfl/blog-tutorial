If you're seeing this post that means the new journal collection is working!

I announce the launch of a new section on my website called "journal".  Even though my school supposedly already has its own system for writing the daily journals, I felt I need my own place so I can have the freedom to write it however I want (which is through this CMS), style it, show it to everybody, and, because the journal is written in Markdown,  export it to a PDF or HTML page.

Alright that's all for today.
