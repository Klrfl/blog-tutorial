So yesterday I got sick, and i'm staying home until today. It isn't that serious, just a fever, but parents were so concerned that I was getting DBD (dengue fever) haha.

The truth was I got sick because I didn't take care of myself well enough. I let my work make me forget about my most basic bodily function, which are moving around, getting enough sleep and drinking enough water.. extra emphasis on the very last part. I got sick because I didn't drink enough. How did I know? For your info, I always bring 2 bottles with me that I always drink, but on Friday, I saw that *I forgot* to drink one bottle. Yea I worked from 08.00 (I arrive at the office at 06.20) to 17.00, not counting the 1 hour 20 mins it took to get to and from the office from my house, and I only drank one bottle. That's not good for my body, is it.. Afterwards I recovered quite slowly so it's understandable that my parents were worried. I had the fever for I think 3 days and a few hours starting from Friday..
