You may have noticed that I again have decided to jump ahead a few days in the journal. It's partly because I'm too lazy to write, haha, but mostly because I do the same stuff over the past three days ,which is implementing CRUD on another resource which still relates to the original new feature I implemented. It's kind of a like a transaction detail where you list out the things you want to buy, the description, and the price, except it's all corporate stuff so I don't really understand it that well.

I forgot to mention that the past 3 days, after it's past 13.00, my head would get very heavy all of a sudden and I would sleep for the next 30 mins. I really feel bad because it's like stealing time that should've been used for productive work...

Nevertheless, I wrote a fair amount of code,  but the only feature I managed to complete and test is getting and deleting the detail items. Hopefully tomorrow I can complete the create and update part. Alright that's it for this week
