This is the day I finally finish my business with that dreaded stored procedure. It's finally working and it's more performant than the old one (felt like the greatest achievement ever). It's off to another empty day... But not so empty though, cause I have to test the entirety of an internal app called MPS.

I have to do end-to-end testing across all 300 pages in that site. Well that number comes from the rows of pages that have to be tested, but in reality the pages are always more than that. One page leads to another and I have to test each page's functionality. Well that's all I can tell you in this post. Wish me luck
