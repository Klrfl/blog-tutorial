Today I felt there wasn't too may tasks, so I kind of didn't do anything for the
morning. Picture me awkwardly staring at the monitor, reading a random documentation
website. Yeah that's me right there.

Then I was tasked on making a landing page. "making" is not really the right
word because its essentially done and it's missing one key feature: There was a
small contact form at the bottom of the page and currently it's not working.
There's another identical page which has a working form... I was thinking to
myself, "why don't they just copy pasted the relevant code?" I genuinely didn't
understand. But whatever, it's better than sitting around all day doing nothing.
Maybe their hands are just that full right now.
