So.. Wednesday. Today Is the final day im fiddling with the new feature request and start testing intensively, everything already came together beautifully, at least when at development. We have no automated integration and end-to-end testing (who does lmao) so if needs to be all manual. Again I've tested all of it and it seems to be ok. Sir Adit didn't give me any additional tasks, because to be fair it's already close to 17.00 and he's got a lot of things to do. And I forgot to mention that I also get to go home earlier day which is always a nice thing
