Today I think is a very good opening to the week, because I finally finished the detail thingy.. yes, the entire CRUD opÃ©ration is fully functional. It took many many tries and sheer willpower to digest the behemoth that is the unreadable codebase I inherited ðŸ˜”, but I finally did it. All I need to do is create better interactions in the frontend, for example when deleting, it should delete the corresponding row in the table too, and when updating the row should update too. After that it's 100% done.

After this I'll move on to 2 other tasks which I reckon will be just as hard if not harder than today. Here's for tomorrow and beyond
