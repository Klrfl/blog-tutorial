Today after looking for the bugs, I was tasked to start fixing them just like
I did with MMS. But unlike MMS, this time it's a far more massive effort, with
more than half of 300+ pages to be fixed... It's going to take a long time. It's
not that complex, just that there are so much pages to work on. 

Sir Adit put some filters on the spreadsheet to let me focus on most critical pages
that needs to be prioritized. Today I managed to fix only a small portion of them, I
think like only 25% to 30%. Let me just work on it for this week, and I'll post an
update when I'm done.
