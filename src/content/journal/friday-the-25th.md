So today is the final day of the week... it is incredible how fast time seems to pass. I felt like I just started the week, but it's already Friday?? Anyways, I finished all 3 of this weeks task. They're not hard to do, it's just that they're hard to get right. I have to tweak and iterate on the styles so many times to get it to look remotely similar to the real document (if you don't know what I'm talking about read the previous posts). The awkward FTP workflow also doesn't help at all, I really should talk to my boss about it.

Sir Adit already gave me another task at the end of the day, still about some corporate agreement letters, but he decided to put it on hold for tomorrow. Good idea, I'm really tired today.
