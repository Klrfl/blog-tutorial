Guess what, it's monday and my first day at the workplace. I tell you right now I'm really happy to get started!

So I arrived at the tower at approximately 11.10, but I didn't immediately work. We went to the 12th floor and after a bit of waiting, the person in charge of the HRD told us that he didn't have our CV yet, so we were asked to fill some biodata. After waiting for some time again for him to come back, it's already 12 o'clock (lol), so we have no option other than waiting again until it's 1 past noon. The HRD person came back, collected the form and transferred us to the manager, who brought us up to main office at the 15th floor. Fun fact, the manager was the one who interviewed me.

Fast forward at the office, we were introduced to some member of the staff, and most importantly to the instructor who got us up to speed with the office and helped us set up our work station. Well not exactly mine because my PC didn't arrive yet and I have to wait until tomorrow, but alas I digress.

My first "task" there is to reset a laptop and install some applications for a trainee. It was quite simple, but turns out there was an issue with the Microsoft account on the laptop, so in turn that makes activating the Office apps problematic. We worked around it by creating a new Microsoft account and activating the Office apps under that new account. The instructor told me to activate the administrator account and to create a local account, all using command prompt.

That's all for today, I hope I can do a good job tomorrow.
