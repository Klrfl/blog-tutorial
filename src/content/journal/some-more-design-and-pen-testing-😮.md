Today is Monday, and like usual I have to show up to work, and show up early. I didn't do much besides polishing and finishing up the website redesign draft in the morning.

Today they gave me access to an internal dashboard where they have all the projects there, but I couldn't see _all_ the projects, just the ones I am authorized to. I noticed that all of them are hosted in a subdomain under metropolitanland.com. Bored, I went to Google and searched for a tool to list all subdomains of a domain. Sure enough, I got a hit. I found some dysfunctional websites which went unused for too long and also potentials security risks. There was one subdomain which hosted an unfinishedsetup of ZenPhotos which is a CMS for gallery sites, where it had database credentials out in the open waiting to be copied. Sir Rudi quickly disabled the domain and several other defunct websites so they can't be accessed from the public internet.

After all of that, sir Rudi told me to tell him if there's anything like that ever happening again. Then sir Adit told me there is going to be a task for me tomorrow. I wonder what the task is
