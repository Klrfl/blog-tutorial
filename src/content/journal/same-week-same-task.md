Today, on Thursday, I picked up where I left off yesterday, applying the SQL query I already wrote to the controller, finishing the task.

Sir Adit gave me another one, where Its basically the same task. But I just repaired an existing one instead of making a new one. To be honest it's not much, just some CSS grid and plain old blade templates, it's not too complicated. The only thing slowing me down is the requirements. I have to replicate exactly like the source material which is just a word document.
