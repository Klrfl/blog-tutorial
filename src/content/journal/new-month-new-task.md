First of all I wanted to say I really regret my decision to not write for the first day of the week... I'm so tired. For starters, I didn't do anything on Monday except configuring NGINX to serve static sites and also serve as a reverse proxy perhaps... I learned a lot   but it's still boring nonetheless.

Today, on Tuesday, Sir Adit gave me a new task. It's a little simpler compared to last month, I have to make two new pages for a printout preview, with some data from the database.  For today I completed the static page, which I tried to make as close as possible to the original Excel page. It was a bunch of tables, so it is only natural that I decided to use CSS Grid for this page. The first page came out pretty good for a 2 hour stint, and the second one.. well it's not as good because I didn't have time to finish it on the same day. I'll continue writing the backend logic tomorrow, and I hope I can finish this as fast as possible, while still writing good code
