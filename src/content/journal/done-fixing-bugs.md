It was 23rd of September, 2024 when I finally finished the dreaded and mighty boring task of fixing around half of 300 pages worth of bugs. It's time to maaaybe take a little break and- whoops, before you know it, another new task has come. It seems simple at first but it really is not: making print-out pages.

This time it was different though, I was tasked to make like 5 different draft pages each with different attachments. I have started to work on it by pasting the text to the HTML page, and I'm working on styling it.

 I will write again in like three weeks when I'm done with this one
