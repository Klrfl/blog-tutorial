Onboarding is the name of the game today. The first thing I did this morning was open my pc and try to serve the application locally. Turns out it can't run like that because the site requires authentication from another central app, so no way to run it locally. Everyone in the dev team doesn't run the app on their computer, instead they edit the file and directly upload the files they edited to a trial server. It does have a slow feedback loop and I think it's not ideal in the long run, but today I didn't code much anyways, just looking around taking a tour and learning what methods of what controller does what.

Sir Adit also gave some help in getting started, he gave me a schematic on how the new feature should be implemented (and I'm deliberately keeping it vague in case it's actually company secret haha).
