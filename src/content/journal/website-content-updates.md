Today after I finished pasting the missing error messages and suggestions in the
spreadsheet, I told sir Adit about it and then proceeded to mostly doing nothing for most of the day, save for working on helping change the company website's content. 
I thought "why does the IT team need to work on website content changes,
don't they (the CRM) have direct access to the CMS?" I think they do but they don't
want to do it so they just assign the IT department to do it for them. Some parts of the content are also hard-coded, so not 100% of the website's text can be edited via the CMS. Then at that moment I remembered that
they told me to make a prototype of a brand new company website that I kind of
neglected for the past few weeks. I think I'll just continue working on that if
They don't have tasks for me.
