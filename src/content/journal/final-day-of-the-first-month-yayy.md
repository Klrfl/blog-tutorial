Ok today is Friday and it's the last day of the week at the office. To be honest I did a whole lot of nothing because yesterday my code is already in the process of merging. It's not really merging because the company doesn't use git (yet) and as a result it's very difficult to merge the existing code with mine. It's partially my fault because I touched a fair amount of code that is beyond my scope.. but I can't help myself but to refactor. I will do better next time.

Today I did learn a little bit on how to configure NGINX and how to set up Laravel with Docker.. I like to be an all-rounder you know... But it's still kinda boring when you don't have anything to do.
