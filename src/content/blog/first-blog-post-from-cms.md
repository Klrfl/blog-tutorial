Hello! Welcome to my blog. Today I am celebrating the fact that I have sucessfully integrated Decap CMS to my test blog (kind of, the I haven't figured out the image yet). Writing YAML is kind of hard, not gonna lie :)

Yea that's it I don't know what else to write lol I just need some content to fill this blog post's body.

**Update** 22/06/23: I just figured out how to insert images into my blog. Turns out in my `config.yml` I need to add a `fields` field, then I need to add a `src` and `alt` field. I also bumped into an error, but It's just a silly syntax error. Yay for me!
