Hello guys. In this post I want to share with you something that I have been thinking about a lot.

## Expresso la feelingso
At first, I made this blog specifically to practice [Astro](https://astro.build)  (probably best JavaScript framework ever) and experimenting how to make a website, but I think this unexpectedly became a new platform for me to express myself, and I want to further use this to my advantage. I'm sorry if this post came off a bit weird, I just want to vent.

Lately I've been thinking a lot about my journey learning web development so far. I feel.. a bit extra. A bit weird. And I think nobody will ever understand my feelings.

## A bit of balance won't hurt

I am currently doing well and can pick up new technologies fast, for example, in the past 3 months I am learning backend technologies (Go, GORM, PostgreSQL) and now mobile (React Native), but I recently thought that all this time and energy I poured into my learning efforts, is actually just an escape from reality. An escape from having to socialize, to meet with other people. And I like it because of that. My other half keeps telling me that I need to keep doing this, honing what my teacher likes to call **hard skills**, so that I can get internships (and jobs later) more easily, but on the other hand, people with connections and excellent social skills will have a better chance of landing a job. And in my opinion, I am not terribly good at conveying information to other people.

I think this is just a matter of me wanting to break out of my comfort zone or not. I already have great technical skills, but I am lacking on the other aspects, the social ones. But it's terrifying! to meet with other people and make mistakes, and to stutter, oh my god that is just the worst thing ever.

## The classic *impostor's syndrome*

You know, I reflect on the fact that I like dealing with computers and code, while my friends are slacking off all day, playing Mobile Legends and freaking Free Fire on their phone (yeah they still play that game for real). (**this part on should just be deldeted lmao**) Everyone's cheering me on and they're like "you're so smart, how can I be like you?". On one hand, I often encourage everyone to keep pushing. "Don't you have anything better to do than to play? Go learn a new framework brother..", "How's that Astro project doing?", or "Why don't you resume that JavaScript playlist from last week?", those sentences I try to utter. But on the other hand I want to just let go and let everything fall to chaos, because, in the end I am not their parent, nor I am their teacher. I'm just their friend. who am I to command them what they should learn? What they should do?.

I kinda feel... superior. Even though I feel bad for them, but at the same time I feel that I am just *better*. BUT at the same time, I also feel that I am greatly lacking. I don't have what they have. And I can't get it. It's so close, yet so far.

Thank you for reading this far. I hope you can take away something positive from this pointless rambling of mine, wkwkwk.
