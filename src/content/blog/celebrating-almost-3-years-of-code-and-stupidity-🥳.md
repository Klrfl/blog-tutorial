Hello everyone, thanks for joining me in this blog post. Looking back, time flew by so fast, and I want to take a step back and admire how far I have come in this journey. From Python to Javascript to Go and TypeScript, I feel like I am finally stepping in the right direction in life.

I still remember opening PyCharm and getting ready to look at HTML/CSS/JS tutorials back in 2021 - yes, I used PyCharm because that is what Mosh told me to use. I don't have screenshots but I still have the file metadata preserved. The first thing I made was a site dedicated to Sebastian Vettel - don't read it tho, it's too cringy haha.

Also I would like to use this occasion to announce a new revamp of my site, which includes some things:

## Search bar

The site page now has a brand new search bar at the top!! yay!!! Powered by Pagefind, now you can search for blog posts and all the pages on the site very easily.

## Decap

This is not public facing, but I just updated the CMS from Netlify CMS to Decap. Not much has changed, but updating it has been quite the adventure üòÅ From the classic "it works on my machine" problem, to nonexistent discussions regarding my problem. But at the end, I fixed it and I can finally write this post!

In the future I will also add custom styling for previews (currently it looks like dog poo haha).

## Plans for the future

Next month in July I will enter a new chapter of life where I will go through On Job Training at Bekasi. It will be a wonderful opportunity to expand my knowlege, connect with other people and just experience new things in general. Thinking about it made me anxious and excited at the same time...

I forgot about the details, but the school requires us students to write a journal (I think they said it's once a day??? my friends said it's once a month) and so I will add a new section in my site so I can share my journal with others. Using this already existing CMS also will help me simplify the process of writing. I can't believe my experiment with Markdown files and headless CMSes led me to this!

Alright that's it for this post. Thanks for reading, you can go away now.
