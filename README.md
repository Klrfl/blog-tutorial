This is my personal website made with Astro and powered by Decap CMS and hosted with Netlify.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

This project uses pnpm, so download it first, either locally or globally.

This command installs pnpm globally, if you want to install locally you can omit the `-g` flag.

```sh
npm install pnpm -g
```

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
